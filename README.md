# Deep_Learning_PUC

Here i uploaded my homework and projects from IIC3697 Deep Learning course, at PUC, taught by professor Álvaro Soto.

Here we worked with Keras, Tensorflow and Pytorch (mainly).

We developed CNN's for the first two homeworks, working with different parameters, arquitectures and loss functions, depening on the task at hand (we also used Triplet and Focal loss).

We also worked with RNN's, mainly LSTMS for time serie forecast, and NLP problems at the end (Seq2Seq attetion models for machine translate and text summarization)
